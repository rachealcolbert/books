## Description

When you load the search engine, you are presented with a menu with the options: Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.

When you click on the Search for Books menu option, you're presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button. If you are not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, you are presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

When you click on the Login/Signup menu option, a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up. When the toggle is set to Signup, then you are presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button. And when the toggle is set to Login, you are presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button.

When you enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button, then your user account is created and you're logged in to the site. When you enter your account’s email address and password and click on the login button, then the modal closes and I am logged in to the site.

When you are logged in to the site, then the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout. When you are logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, then you're presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account.

When you click on the Save button on a book, then that book’s information is saved to my account. Wehn you click on the option to see my saved books, then you are presented with all of the books you have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account.

When you click on the Remove button on a book, then that book is deleted from my saved books list and when you click on the Logout button, then you are logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
